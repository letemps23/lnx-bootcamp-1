Linux Bootcamp series

## Start the journey to take your career to the next level

DevOps, Cloud, and SRE roles are some of the most in-demand and highest-paying jobs in Tech.  
the skill they all have in common is **Linux**  

My goal is to help you land one of these jobs in the next 3 - 6 months.  
To achieve this goal, I have developped a series of bootcamps around Linux and related technologies. 

*Are you a traditional sysadmin that feels he is still practicing iron age techniques ?*  
*Are you a fresher that wants to step quickly into devops ?*  
*Are you from other area of expertise and litterally attracted by the Cloud ecosystem ?*  
*Is your ambition just to give yourself chances to earn a ###.### figure salary ?*  
*Or do you have natively an SRE mindset that leads you find out what's under the hood ?*  

Then let's get started !
