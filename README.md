Linux Bootcamp series

## start the journey to take your career to the next level

DevOps, Cloud, SRE roles are among the most in demand and most paid jobs in Tech.  
the skill they all have in common is **Linux**  

My ambition is to help you land one of those jobs in the next 3 - 6 months.  
I have created this series of bootcamps around Linux and its related technologies to achieve that specific goal. 

*Are you a traditional sysadmin that feels he is still practicing iron age techniques ?*  
*Are you a fresher that wants to step quickly into devops ?*
*Are you from other area of expertise and litterally attracted by the Cloud ecosystem ?*
*Is your ambition just to give yourself chances to earn a ###.### figure salary ?*
*Or do you have natively an SRE mindset that leads you find out what's under the hood ?*

Then let's get started !
