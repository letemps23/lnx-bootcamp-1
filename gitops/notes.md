## CRASH COURSE

### Intro

1. Linus,again !  
   At the beginning, Git was for Linux kernel devs ...  
   very geek, then ...  
2. First goal: version control (history tracking)  
   version = series of changes  
   * importance of atomicity of the changes  
   * within the version, there are data and metadata  
   * the history is not necessary linear  
   
3. Second goal: Collaboration
4. Third goal: DevOps

### use git locally

1. create a directory *studentx_repo1* in your home folder
2. inside that directory, run: ```git init```
3. with *ls -a*, notice a .git subdirectory has been created ; it contains your history  
4.
